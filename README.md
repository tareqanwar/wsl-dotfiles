# dotfiles
My WSL configuration files.

### usage
Just run `install.sh` to install zsh (including oh-my-zsh and other important stuff) and symlink all dotfiles.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tareqanwar/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ sudo ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

To keep up to date, you can just `pull` this repo, and re-run `install.sh`.
